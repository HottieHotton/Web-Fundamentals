           Hello, my name is Braxton Hotton! I live in West Jordan, UT and I'm a husband
           wonderful father of a beautiful almost 6 month old son named James!
        </p>
        <p>
           I have a Full-Stack Web Development Certificate from the University of Utah Coding
           Bootcamp. You may be wondering why I'm in this class if I already have a 
           certification, well, to put it shortly, job market is really tough out there!
           So I'm back at school furthering my education to help make an impact to my
           community and classmates! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out
           to me!
