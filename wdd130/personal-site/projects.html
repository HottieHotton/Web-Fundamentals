          This assignment is someting I worked on when I started at BYU-I. It's

          Warehouse Returns is a project I helped create when I was at the
          bootcamp. This idea was created to create a concept to help a returns
          database be more simple and grouped properly. I helped with the
          backend with linking pages together, handling authentication tokens,
          and other functionality of the website.

          Pards-React was the final project that I helped with in the bootcamp,
          and my most accomplished project. This website was created through a
          connection one of my teammates knew who wanted a fresh looking
          website. Pards sells trailer hitches and tools tied with it. I helped
          with the front end using React.js, giving the website a clean look and
          a really good design for users to look and work with.
