      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My purpose for this site is to provide visitors an expereince
        to see who I am and my potential as a future Web Developer. I want 
        to see a very clean web page with all functioning buttons and links!
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audiance would be directed to recruiters of different companies
         and those who want to know who my skills are. I also think my audiance 
         should be towards anyone who wants to be a developer themselves so they 
         can see what they can do for themselves as well!

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This is where I will lightly introduce my website. I don't need 
        it to be anything busy, just a easy welcome page that allow users 
        to feel comfortable moving from page to page. By having a non-busy 
        home page, it'll give me more opportunity on other pages to expand 
        on who I am and what skills I possess. This will also attract more 
        users since people don't like entering clutterly websites.

      </ul>
      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        This part is where I would introduce myself and who I am. 
        I want to explain roughly where I'm from and what I like to do. 
        I'll then go on and explain my skills and experience that I have 
        from this career. I'll also talk about what other skills I could 
        bring to the table as an employee and reference my projects page 
        to guide them there to see what I'm capable of.

      </ul>
      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        This page is where I will show off some of my projects that I completed 
        whether by myself or in classes from bootcamp or college. I will also 
        explain 2-3 projects and what they are supposed to accomplish in the 
        real world. With that, I'll explain what parts I played in while putting 
        those projects together. By doing this it will allow me to help the visitors 
        examine those areas and have them see what I can do.
